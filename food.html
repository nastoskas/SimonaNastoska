        <h2>Cabbage rolls (sarma)</h2>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <b>For the Cabbage Leaves</b> <br>
            Pickled (Fermented) Cabbage Leaves or a head of fresh Cabbage – separate the cabbage into its leaves, away from the core. <br>
            <b>Water</b> <br>
            <b>Salt </b><br>
           <b>For the Filling</b>  <br>
            Oil: Olive oil is my go-to for this recipe, but you could substitute another kind of oil as desired. Butter, ghee, and bacon grease would also work (keep in mind that animal fats would make this a meatless recipe rather than strictly vegan).
            <br> Onions: The onions should be finely diced.
            <br> Garlic: You want to use a generous amount of fresh garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press.
            <br> Parsley: Like paprika, parsley is a must-have ingredient in Macedonian cooking.
            <br> Tomatoes: Take two fresh tomatoes, and chop them finely.
            <br>Tomato Paste: A small amount of tomato paste adds depth to the cabbage roll filling.
            <br>Paprika: You’ll want sweet paprika here, not smoked or hot paprika.
            <br> Salt and Pepper
            <br>Dried Herbs: Oregano and thyme bring a pungent, herbal fragrance.
            <br>Lemon Pepper: Lemon pepper seasoning makes the rice filling irresistible!
            <br>Rice: Use your favorite long-grain white rice.
            <br> Walnuts: The final touch to the cabbage rolls is to include a halved walnut in each one.
            <br><b>For the Sauce</b>
            <br>Oil: A little more oil for sauteing.
            <br>Garlic: Mince the garlic, or press it.
            <br>Paprika: Again, sweet paprika, rather than smoked or hot paprika.
            <br>Water: The water should be hot before adding it to the other ingredients.
